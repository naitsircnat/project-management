- use better named constants in test (no caps)
- exception and validation
- refactoring for controller and service test for getAll? (mock projects and list of projects are repeated)
- BEST PRACTICES (can compare also with TWU code?)
- variable naming, e.g. for button handles
- able to shorten any parts?
